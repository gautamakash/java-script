Java-Script.js is inspride by Java frameworks and give developer to design a true JavaScript pattern application without unnecessary overenginered framework and concepts, it use well stablish Java Frameworks and also use Object Orient Programming JavaScript.

  - Java inspired package and class classification and implementation
  - Auto template binding
  - Aspect proxy to create truly OOPS objects.
  - Configure base BeanFactory for easy defination and DATA layer,
  - Auto Data bind with server.
  - Direct object subscription to make subscription and async application easy
You can also:
  - Id based subscrioption to complete flexiblity
  - Serialize object
  - Update object when whant to update for resource optimization
  - Equal and other usefull method to compare actual serialized value

System class to implement all above and can also have multiple system.  As [Akash Gautam] describe on below basic example

> var system = new System({
>    debug: false, // if enable then log class proxy in console
>    beanFactory:{  // define data bean factory configuration
>        "com.magnifyall.product.Laptop":{  // key is package
>            url: "data/product/{{id}}.json"    // data service url where {{id}} is object id
>        }
>    }
>});
